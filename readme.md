> Linter for [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)

## Usage

Install [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) like you normally would in your project. The extension will pickup the configuration in your workspace just like running [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) in your terminal would. You will be able to see your linter work as you type and easily format your code.

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev xo
```

or

```shell
$ yarn add -D xo
```

## How it works

The xo extension searches up when you open a file for a package.json with `xo` listed as a dependency.

## Auto Format JS/TS Files XO

You can enable XO as a formatter for TypeScript and JavaScript.

In either your workspace or user settings add the following settings.

> optionally turn on "editor.formatOnSave"

```json
{
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	"xo.enable": true,
	"xo.format.enable": true,
	"[javascript]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "samverschueren.linter-xo"
	},
	"[typescript]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "samverschueren.linter-xo"
	}
}
```

## Commands

To use: pull up the command pallete (usually `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P`) and start typing `xo`.

If you notice that lint results are jumping all over the place, or a long delay in fixing files, turn this up. The max is 350ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Could use with Deno, yarn pnp, or to have the xo library lint itself.

This may cause different results from the cli if you are using a different version of node. You can set a runtime path so that you are always using the same node version. <br/><br/>example:<br/>`"xo.runtime": "/usr/local/bin/node"`                                                                                                                                              |

## Recent Updates

- v3.12.0

  - Refactor and architectural changes to support better logic around xo resolution
    - Previously required xo to be in the root folder of the vscode workspace
    - Now only requires that xo is a dependency in any parent directory. The extension now looks up from the file it is linting for a package.json with xo as a dependency.
    - Caching now happens on a per folder basis and is cleaned up as files are closed and recached when they open. This helps simplify logic and able to remove a lot of supporting code and alleviates problems from stale cache.
  - fixes a bug where eslint-plugins/configs without docs would throw an error

- v3.11.0

  - Adds validate option to allow formatting more file types

- v3.10.0

  - Adds ignore rule Code Actions for both single line or file.
  - Adds logic to use metaResults from xo .51+ and fallback to eslint-rule-docs for older versions
  - Internal improves fixing logic for overlapping rules
  - Move from objects to Maps for rule caching

- v3.9.0

  - Adds links to rule documents

## Known Issues

- Turning on the setting "files.trimTrailingWhitespace" to true can cause a race condition with xo that causes code to get erroneously trimmed when formatting on save. This typically only occurs when debounce is turned (above 0 ms). Avoid using both "files.trimTrailingWhitespace" and "xo.debounce" options at the same time.
